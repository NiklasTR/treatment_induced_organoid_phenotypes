```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I quickly loaded the CCP annotation and created this graph. 

```{r}
drug_targets %>%
  filter(broad_summary != "control" & grepl(input, pattern = "mit") != TRUE) %>%
  group_by(broad_summary) %>%
  mutate(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(count) %>%
  ungroup(broad_summary) %>%
  mutate(broad_summary = factor(broad_summary, levels = broad_summary %>% unique())) %>%
  ggplot(aes(broad_summary)) + 
  geom_histogram(stat = "count") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  ggtitle("Composition of clinical target compound panel") + 
  xlab("Molecular mechansims") + 
  ylab("Count")
  
```
