How to run the script export_h5_to_tif.py:

What to do the first time:
1. Check if you have python3 installed by running in your terminal:
python3 --version
2. Create a virtual environment (somewhere in your computer not in the promise project e.g. an Environments directory) by running:
python3 -venv promise_virtualenv
3. Activate virtual environment by running:
source promise_virtualenv/bin/activate
4. Move to the directory where the file requirements.txt is and run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
(it may tell you that pip is outdated, do what it says to update it)

How to run the script:
1. Everytime you run the script you have to do step 3 of the previous list.
2. Move to the directory where you want the images to be and run:
python path/to/the/file/export_h5_to_tif.py /path/of/the/h5/file/you/want/to/convert/ (path starting from /promise/...)
3. You will be asked for a password which is "heidelberg"
4. The script will first import the chosen file and then create a directory named after the imported file +_TIFF which
contains the converted tif files
