The folder 'PROMISE' contains the source code for the watchdog package.

To install from source run:
R CMD BUILD PROMISE
R CMD CHECK PROMISE_[version].tar.gz
R CMD INSTALL -l /collab-ag-fischer/Rlibs PROMISE_[version].tar.gz

The 'CHECK' command will return some warnings and notes (currently 1 warning 
and 2 notes). This is OK. The check command is only meant to prevent fatal 
errors.

The '-l [R Library]' tells it where to install the library to. This is 
necessary when installing on the cluster so the compute-nodes know where 
to look. It's not necessary when installing on a local machine with only
one Rlib.
