This directory contains raw images as well as raw feature data. When processed, images are moved to the *inbox* directory directly from the INCELL 6000 microscope. 
Please consult this wiki for more information: https://b110-sv6.inet.dkfz-heidelberg.de/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=boutroslab&title=PROMISE+Workflow
