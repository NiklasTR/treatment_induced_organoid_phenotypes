==============================

Human Cancer Organoid Profiling Project at the German Cancer Research Center


Hackathon agenda: 
* manuscript
    * last version
    * comments
    * upcoming version
* overview github repo
    * separate existence of SCOPE package with rest of repository (especially relevant for package data within SCOPE)
    * ground truth file for organoid classification
    * RNA expression data harmonization


Note for contributors
------------
the most up-to-date branch is "niklas". Please merge your contributions to this branch.
I plan to merge niklas and master in 08/21

To-Do
------------
File transfer:
* ctg data


Gene expression
* data were generated via the DKFZ GPCF
* raw data is stored in .CEL format under data/raw/expression, data relating to the latest manuscript is separated under microarray_manuscript
* a normalized file, also deposited at GEO, is generated
    
Analysis Pipeline
------------


raw.hdf -- FeatureAnalysis -> pca.hdf & raw.hdf
pca.hdf -- UMAP ->
